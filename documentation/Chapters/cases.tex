		\section{Solution including all improvements}
			Until this point the improvements were only run separated from each other (except the second improvement). However the final goal was to used them all in the simulator and check how it effects the outcome.
			\subsection*{Initial conditions}
			The initial conditions remained the same, except additional parameters were necessary to provide for the improvements. The initial conditions with the additional parameters can be found in Table \ref{tab:new_array}. The table contains the time intervals whenever a driver is not paying attention as well as the acceleration threshold values.
			\begin{table}
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| }
						\hline
						Id & ... & Time interval of driving without attention & $a_{\rm p,tr}$\\
						$[-]$ & & [s]& $\rm [m/s^2]$\\
						\hline
						1 & ... & 24-26 & 1.2 \\
						2 & ... & 0-2 & 1.2 \\
						3 & ... & 10-12 & 1.3 \\
						4 & ... & 0-3, 22-24, 25-25.5 & 1.3 \\
						5 & ... & 15-19 & 1.6 \\
						6 & ... & 15-16.5 & 1.6 \\
						7 & ... & 0-2 & 1.3 \\
						8 & ... & - & 1.1 \\
						9 & ... & 0-3 & 1.3 \\
						1 & ... & 0-4,15-18.5 & 1.7 \\
						\hline

			\subsection*{Summary of the result}
			The results can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:red_light_situationh2}, \ref{fig:red_light_situationv2} and \ref{fig:red_light_situationcc2}. The results shows that including all improvement the overall duration has increased to \casetime{5}from the original \casetime{1}seconds.
