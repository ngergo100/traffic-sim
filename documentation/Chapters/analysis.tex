	\section{Self driving car variations}
		To test the effect of autonomous drivers in traffic, the same red traffic light situation was implemented. However in this case one of the driver's parameters have been substituted with an autonomous driver parameters. The most representative figure of the result of this task is where the count of cars passed the target line - 100 meters - is illustrated as a function of time. Cars one by one have been exchanged and then simulated with the reaming cars. So a total of ten simulations were run. The result can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:vehicle_density}.

			\label{fig:vehicle_density}
		\end{figure}

		As Figure \ref{fig:vehicle_density} shows the first car reaches the target line in ~13 seconds. The interesting part is at the top right corner of the figure, where it can be seen that depending on which car has been exchanged the overall elapsed time can change up to 10 \%. The minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation values can be found in Table \ref{tab:vehicle_density_minmaxavg}.
		\begin{table}[ht]
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|}
					\hline
					Minimum& Maximum & Average& Standard deviation\\
					\hline
					27.8s&31s&30.24s&1.25s\\
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}

		\end{table}
		
		In the hope of a better figure the same simulation results are shown on Figure \ref{fig:vehicle_density_avg} with averaged representation. It is slightly better than previously.

		\end{figure}
		
		The previous simulations were run with only 1 self-driving car but in different positions. It can be seen that based on the position 1 autonomous driver can help the traffic and make it faster. Lets try the same simulation but this time run it with 2 autonomous driver in place.
